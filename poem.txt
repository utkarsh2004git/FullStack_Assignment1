In the forest of dreams, where whispers sigh,
And moonbeams dance 'neath the starry sky,
There lies a path, unseen by day,
Where the heart finds solace in its gentle sway.

The breeze, a poet with tales to tell,
Weaves through the trees, a magic spell,
And as it sings, the leaves do rustle,
A symphony of nature's hustle.

In this enchanted realm, time stands still,
And worries fade, as if by will,
For here in the forest of dreams untold,
The spirit finds peace in the stories old.

So let us wander, hand in hand,
Through this mystical and wondrous land,
Where every step is a journey begun,
In the forest of dreams, where all are one.
